# Bad Bandaid CSS Grid Template Areas Framework

This is an ongoing, responsive CSS Grid named template areas for my testing projects. The idea of the file structure was based on Hugo's [Sass boilerplate](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate). So yeah I tweaked it a bit to my liking. But check out he's architecture, guidelines and other great info.

## What's New:
- Sticky Navbar -
- 100% width set to default -
- Most SVG icons are inline, I have an icons repo but I want to make a new set -

 [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout) introduces a two-dimensional grid system to CSS. In addition, I gave it a bit of Flexbox to a full screen landing page thanks to [Traversy Media's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)  [tutorial ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRmQN244Ir0),  helped me create one. The Navigation bar is also on flex-box, so I can have a reference of it in the mix as-well.

Indexed and structured with SCSS ([Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)) files and directories. It's butt ugly and basic but it's for visual feedback I guess. :)
