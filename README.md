# Bad Band-aid CSS Grid Template Areas Framework

**This is an ongoing, responsive CSS Grid named template areas project.**
## What's New:
- Version 1.0 Jan. 2018!
- Deleted or renamed func-ext-mixins.scss to bandaid.scss and merged its helpers to base for Sass to compile top level CSS to the top. Bandaid scss file is basically for testing, vendor, to-do etc. -
- CSS color variables on base file, left Sass color variables for now but not forgotten :). -
- Changed the default font stack, commented out margin and padding from the universal CSS selector and for it to inherit box-sizing from HTML -

 [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout) introduces a two-dimensional grid system to CSS. In addition, I gave it a bit of Flexbox to a full screen page and the nav links section as a reference of it as well.
